cryptocurrency tracking tools

Components to build:
1 CLI tool for displaying current prices
2 cron-like tool for notifications on price changes
3 CLI tool for managing, checking current wallets (optional)
  - this is mostly useful for knowing when to sell and can be combined with 2

## TODO
- color code percent changes based on magnitude of change
